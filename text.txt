Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest!!!
When you get older, plainer, saner
Will you remember all the danger
We came from?
Burning like embers, falling, tender
Longing for the days of no surrender
Years ago
And well you know
